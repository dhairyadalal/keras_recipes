    "\n",
    "A statistical language model is learned from raw text and predicts the probability of the next word in the sequence given the words already present in the sequence. Language models are a key component in larger models for challenging natural language processing problems, like machine translation and speech recognition. They can also be developed as standalone models and used for generating new sequences that have the same statistical properties as the source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models both learn and predict one word at a time. The training of the network involves providing sequences of words as input that are processed one at a time where a prediction can be made and learned for each input sequence. Similarly, when making predictions, the process can be seeded with one or a few words, then predicted words can be gathered and presented as input on subsequent predictions in order to build up a generated output sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, each model will involve splitting the source text into input and output sequences, such that the model can learn to predict words. There are many ways to frame the sequences from a source text for language modeling. In this tutorial, we will explore 3 different ways of developing word-based language models in the Keras deep learning library. There is no single best approach, just different framings that may suit different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model 1: One word in, one word out sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Given one word as the input, the model will learn to prededict the next word in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first step is to encode the text as integers. Each lowercase word in the source text is assigned a unique integer and we can convert the sequences of words to sequences of integers. Keras provides the Tokenizer class that can be used to perform this encoding. First, the Tokenizer is fit on the source text to develop the mapping from words to unique integers. Then sequences of text can be converted to sequences of integers by calling the texts to sequences() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will need to know the size of the vocabulary later for both defining the word embedding layer in the model, and for encoding output words using a one hot encoding. The size of the vocabulary can be retrieved from the trained Tokenizer by accessing the word index attribute. We add one, because we will need to specify the integer for the largest encoded word as an array index, e.g. words encoded 1 to 21 with array indicies 0 to 21 or 22 positions. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, we need to create sequences of words to fit the model with one word as input and one word as output."

    "We are now ready to define the neural network model. The model uses a learned word embedding in the input layer. This has one real-valued vector for each word in the vocabulary, where each word vector has a specified length. In this case we will use a 10-dimensional projection. The input sequence contains a single word, therefore the input length=1. The model has a single hidden LSTM layer with 50 units. This is far more than is needed. The output layer is comprised of one neuron for each word in the vocabulary and uses a softmax activation function to ensure the output is normalized to look like a probability.\n",

Technically, we are modeling a multiclass classification problem (predict the word in the vocabulary), therefore using the categorical cross entropy loss function. We use the efficient Adam implementation of gradient descent and track accuracy at the end of each epoch. The model is fit for 500 training epochs, again, perhaps more than is needed. The network configuration was not tuned for this and later experiments; an over-prescribed configuration was chosen to ensure that we could focus on the framing of the language model."
